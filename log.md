##### Starting of the journey

### Day 0: June 30, 2020, Tuesday
##### Studied django models for djangoproject documentation

**Today's progress** Applied all that I studied in a simple Django app

**Thoughts**: I started of in a half hearted way as I never have been a 
              fan of reading documentation but I definitly read and applied 
              everything in this app.

**Link(s) to work**: will be adding tomorrow.
